# dmgrstuff.github.io

This is the repo for [my website](https://dmgrstuff.github.io) and everything hosted on it (for the most part). It's pretty much just self-promotion right now, but maybe I'll use it for something useful one of these days.

I wrote the HTML/CSS for this site basically off my (very limited) existing knowledge, W3Schools tutorials, and Stack Overflow threads, so feel free to laugh at my ~~shameless copy-pasting~~ code.
